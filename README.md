## What does Unchain do?

* Provides sobriety counter that can be synced between multiple  devices to help you visualize and track your progress towards sobriety
* Maintains a history of all past sobriety streaks
* Grants achievements for sobriety time milestones
* Features a built in panic button to direct the user to helpful resources catered to their specific addiction.

## Why make this app?

I was scrolling through social media when I saw people looking for an app that could help them track their sobriety progress. Having recently learned web application development, I saw this as a perfect opportunity to make an app to help them keep free from their addictive habits and achieve their sobriety goals. I knew that I was capable of making something that could make a positive impact on these people's lives. I could not miss that opportunity.

## How much does it cost?

Nothing! This app is **entirely free** to use! There are no ads, microtransactions, or in-app-purchases in this app. If someone is asking you to pay to use this app, they are scamming you.

## Feel free to contribute!

This project is open source! Feel free to contribute to the codebase to further improve the app. Tips are also highly appreciated as they help support me while improving the app as well pay for expenses such as server costs.
